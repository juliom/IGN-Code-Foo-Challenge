My name is Julio Mejia.
I was born in Monterrey, Mexico on July the 16th 1980.
I have an Engineering Degree in Electronics and Communications and most of my porgramming experience is with C.
I currently work as a Remote Desktop Engineer for ACS supporting the MillerCoors Brewing Company (MGD is my favorite american beer).  I provide all kind of IT Support for the Milwaukee Corporate offices and Chicago head quarters.  Right now we are going through a transition process because Miller decided to switch their IT company from ACS to IBM. Before this job, I was working for GE Money as a Quality Analyst, but the company changed their operations to Guetemala so it was the end of the road for many of us with GE. Before that I had several day time jobs while trying to pursue a musical career as a guitar player, which was not very successful.
Last year I completed my CCNA certification and I'm currently learning Java on my own.
I would deffinitely love to joing the video game industry, specially working for IGN, and maybe in a near future start a vide game or application development studio/company.
